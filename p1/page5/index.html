	<h2>Amazon link goes in here</h2>
	<p><strong>Book Summary:</strong></p>
	<p>Geralt is a Witcher, a man whose magic powers, enhanced by long training and a mysterious elixir, have made him a brilliant fighter and a merciless assassin. Yet he is no ordinary murderer: his targets are the multifarious monsters and vile fiends that ravage the land and attack the innocent.</p>
	<p>But not everything monstrous-looking is evil and not everything fair is good…and in every fairy tale there is a grain of truth.</p>
	<p><strong>Review:</strong></p>
	<p><em>"This is a series you can sink your teeth into."</em>―BuzzFeed News</p>
	<p><em>"Delightful, intense, irreverent, and compelling....you have to read The Witcher books because they are rife with all of the elements that make you love fiction, and especially fantasy, in the first place....In a word, The Witcher delivers."</em>―Hypable</p>
	<p><em>"One of the best and most interesting fantasy series I've ever read."</em>―Nerds of a Feather</p>
	<p><em>"Like Mieville and Gaiman, [Sapkowski] takes the old and makes it new ... fresh take on genre fantasy."</em>―Foundation</p>
	<p><em>"Sapkowski has a confident and rich voice which permeates the prose and remains post-translation. I'd recommend this to any fan of heroic or dark fiction."</em>―SF Book Reviews</p>
