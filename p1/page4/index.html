	<h1>1) The Last Wish (Witcher short story collection)</h1>
	<h2>Amazon link goes in here</h2>
	<p><strong>Book Summary:</strong></p>
	<p>Geralt is a Witcher, a man whose magic powers, enhanced by long training and a mysterious elixir, have made him a brilliant fighter and a merciless assassin. Yet he is no ordinary murderer: his targets are the multifarious monsters and vile fiends that ravage the land and attack the innocent.</p>
	<p>But not everything monstrous-looking is evil and not everything fair is good…and in every fairy tale there is a grain of truth.</p>
	<p><strong>Highlights by Kindle readers:</strong></p>
	<p>“Because it would be the first proof I’ve ever heard of that a lack of faith has any kind of power at all.”</p>
	<p>"The result was pseudo-pretty women with the angry and cold eyes of ugly girls. Girls who couldn’t forget their ugliness had been covered by the mask of magic only for the prestige of their profession."</p>
	<p>"In order to become a witcher, you have to be born in the shadow of destiny, and very few are born like that."</p>
