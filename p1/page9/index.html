	<h1>6) The Lady of the Lake (Book Six of The Witcher Saga)</h1>
	<p><strong>Book Summary:</strong></p>
	<p>Trapped in a world ruled by the Elves, separated from Geralt and her destiny, Ciri will need all her training as a fighter and sorceress to survive in the fifth novel of the Witcher, Andrzej Sapkowski’s groundbreaking epic fantasy series that inspired the hit Netflix show and the blockbuster video games.</p>
	<p>After walking through the portal in the Tower of Swallows and narrowly escaping death, Ciri finds herself in a completely different world. . . an Elven world. Time does not seem to exist and there are no obvious borders or portals to cross back into her home world. She is trapped.</p>
	<p>But this is the child of prophecy, and she will not be defeated. She knows she must escape to finally rejoin the Witcher and his companions—and also to conquer her worst nightmare. Leo Bonhart, the man who chased, wounded, and tortured Ciri, is still on her trail. And the world is still at war.</p>
	<p><strong>Book Reviews:</strong></p>
	<p>"Because a story where the decent ones die and the scoundrels live and carry on doing what they want is full of sh*t."</p>
	<p>"For whoever doesn’t overcome the cowardice inside themselves will die of fear to the end of their days."</p>
	<p>"The past, present and future lurk in every moment of time. Eternity is hidden in every moment of time."</p>
