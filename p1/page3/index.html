	<h1>A Rundown on The Witcher Books</h1>
	<p>The Witcher Saga revolves around the series’ main protagonist, <strong>Geralt of Rivia</strong>. He is a witcher, which are beast hunters trained at a young age to develop supernatural abilities to hunt and kill monsters and wild beasts. Geralt was trained at the stronghold of the Wolf School Witchers, where he endured numerous brutal physical and mental challenges to gain near-superhuman mental and physical abilities.</p>
	<p>After the first major war between the Northern Kingdoms and Nilfgaard Empire, Geralt travels across the Continent to kill monsters and protect Ciri, the prophesied child who is said to be born with the power to either save or destroy them all.</p>
	<p>The Witcher Saga is known to be one of the best internationally bestselling fantasy series of all time. Geralt of Rivia’s adventure continues even after the book saga. CD Projekt Red developed an action role-playing video game based on the book series, which has sold over 33 million copies worldwide.</p>
	<p>Netflix has also adapted the book cycle into an exciting series called The Witcher starring Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia, and Lauren Hissrich as the showrunner.</p>
