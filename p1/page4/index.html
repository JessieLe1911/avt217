	<h1>1) The Last Wish (Witcher short story collection)</h1>
	<p><strong>Book Summary:</strong></p>
	<p>Book Summary: Geralt is a Witcher, a man whose magic powers, enhanced by long training and a mysterious elixir, have made him a brilliant fighter and a merciless assassin. Yet he is no ordinary murderer: his targets are the multifarious monsters and vile fiends that ravage the land and attack the innocent.
	<p>But not everything monstrous-looking is evil and not everything fair is good…and in every fairy tale there is a grain of truth.</p>
	<p><strong>Book Reviews:</strong></p>
	<p>This is a series you can sink your teeth into.</p>
	<p><em>-Amazon Reviewer</em></p>
	<p>It is [his] world-weariness combined with his battle-honed powers that make Geralt such an interesting character. Here’s hoping The Last Wish is merely the opening chapter in his English language adventures.</p>
