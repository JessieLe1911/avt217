	<h1>5) The Tower of the Swallow (Book Five in the Witcher Books Series)</h1>
	<p><strong>Book Summary:</strong></p>
	<p>The world has fallen into war. Ciri, the child of prophecy, has vanished.
	<p>Hunted by friends and foes alike, she has taken on the guise of a petty bandit and lives free for the first time in her life. But the net around her is closing.</p>
	<p>Geralt, the Witcher, has assembled a group of allies including Dandelion, Milva, Regis, and Cahir, to rescue her. Both sides of the war have sent brutal mercenaries to hunt her down. Her crimes have made her famous.
	<p>There is only one place left to run. The tower of the swallow is waiting…</p>
	<p><strong>Book Reviews:</strong></p>
	<p>It is [his] world-weariness combined with his battle-honed powers that make Geralt such an interesting character. Here’s hoping The Last Wish is merely the opening chapter in his English language adventures.</p>
	<p><em>-Amazon Reviewer</em></p>
	<p>I really, really enjoyed this book … None of the characters in Sapkowski’s world are black or white; they are all shades of grey, including Geralt and the monsters.</p>
