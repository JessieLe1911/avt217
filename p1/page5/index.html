	<h1>2) Blood of Elves (Book One of The Witcher Saga)</h1>
	<p><strong>Book Summary:</strong></p>
	<p>The story of Geralt of Rivia continues as war rages on in this epic fantasy—now, the story of The Witcher continues in the saga that inspired the second season of the Netfix series.</p>
	<p>For over a century, humans, dwarves, gnomes, and elves have lived together in relative peace. But times have changed, the uneasy peace is over, and now the races are fighting once again. The only good elf, it seems, is a dead elf.</p>
	<p>Geralt of Rivia, the cunning hunter known as the Witcher, has been waiting for the birth of a prophesied child. This child has the power to change the world—for good or for evil.</p>
	<p>As the threat of war hangs over the land and the child is hunted for her extraordinary powers, it will become Geralt's responsibility to protect them all. And the Witcher never accepts defeat.</p>
	<p><strong>Book Reviews:</strong></p>
	<p>"When you know about something it stops being a nightmare. When you know how to fight something, it stops being so threatening."</p>
	<p>"I know you’re almost forty, look almost thirty, think you’re just over twenty and act as though you’re barely ten."</p>
	<p>"You have made a mistake. You mistook the stars reflected in the surface of the lake at night for the heavens."</p>
