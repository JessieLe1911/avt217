	<h1>3) Time of Contempt (Book Three in the Witcher Books Series)</h1>
	<p><strong>Book Summary:</strong></p>
	<p>Geralt is a witcher: guardian of the innocent; protector of those in need; a defender, in dark times, against some of the most frightening creatures of myth and legend. His task, now, is to protect Ciri. A child of prophecy, she will have the power to change the world for good or for ill — but only if she lives to use it.</p>
	<p><strong>Book Reviews:</strong></p>
	<p>Like Mieville and Gaiman, [Sapkowski] takes the old and makes it new … fresh take on genre fantasy.</p>
	<p><em>-Amazon Reviewer</em></p>
	<p>A breath of fresh air in a well-worn genre. Don’t miss it!</p>
