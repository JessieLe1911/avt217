	<h1>2) Blood of Elves (Book One of The Witcher Saga)</h1>
	<p><strong>Book Summary:</strong></p>
	<p>TFor over a century, humans, dwarves, gnomes, and elves have lived together in relative peace. But times have changed, the uneasy peace is over, and now the races are fighting once again. The only good elf, it seems, is a dead elf.
	<p>Geralt of Rivia, the cunning assassin known as the Witcher, has been waiting for the birth of a prophesied child. This child has the power to change the world — for good, or for evil.</p>
	<p>As the threat of war hangs over the land and the child is hunted for her extraordinary powers, it will become Geralt’s responsibility to protect them all. And the Witcher never accepts defeat.</p>
	<p><strong>Book Reviews:</strong></p>
	<p>Sapkowski has a phenomenal gift for narrative, inventing sensational events, creating a suggestive mood, and building up the suspense along with a dazzling, slightly cynical sense of humor.</p>
	<p><em>-Amazon Reviewer</em></p>
	<p>Sapkowski’s The Last Wish is a great collection of short stories centered around a witcher, Geralt – a rare sorcerous breed who hunts down the monstrous but is feared by the innocent. With a wondrous mix of Eastern European folklore and myth, beautiful princesses, mischievous demons and where all is not as it seems, The Last Wish is a great read – perfect for dipping into or just reading cover to cover, as I did.</p>
