		<h1>Who Is Andrzej Sapkowski?</h1>
		<p>Before Andrzej Sakowski became popular for writing The Witcher Saga, he first worked as a high-ranking sales representative for a foreign trade company after studying economics at the University of Łódź.</p>
		<p>His literary career started when he became a part-time translator of science fiction. His first short story, The Witcher, was written on a whim so he could enter a writing contest hosted by Polish science fiction and fantasy magazine Fantastyka.</p>
		<p>Because of marketing knowledge and skills, he bagged the 3rd prize even though it’s his first time joining the said competition. After his short story was published in Fantastyka in 1986, it was met with wide and positive acclaim among critics and readers.</p>
		<p>Sakowski’s success with The Witcher compelled him to write a fantasy book cycle based on the original short story, earning him worldwide success.</p>
