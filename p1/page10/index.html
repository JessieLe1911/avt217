	<h1>7) Season of Storms (Book Seven in the Witcher Books Series)</h1>
	<p><strong>Book Summary:</strong></p>
	<p>Before he was the guardian of Ciri, the child of destiny, Geralt of Rivia was a legendary swordsman. Join the Witcher as he undertakes a deadly mission in this stand-alone adventure set in the Andrzej Sapkowki’s groundbreaking epic fantasy world that inspired the hit Netflix show and the blockbuster video games.</p>
	<p>Geralt of Rivia is a Witcher, one of the few capable of hunting the monsters that prey on humanity. He uses magical signs, potions, and the pride of every Witcher—two swords, steel and silver.</p>
	<p>But a contract has gone wrong, and Geralt finds himself without his signature weapons. Now he needs them back, because sorcerers are scheming, and across the world clouds are gathering.</p>
	<p>The season of storms is coming. . .</p>
	<p><em>Season of Storms is the sixth novel and eighth overall book in the Witcher series. It is not a sequel to the original Witcher Saga, but rather is set between the short stories in the first book in the series, The Last Wish.</em></p>
	<p><strong>Book Reviews:</strong></p>
	<p>"It was as you said: what you used to be means more to people than what you are."</p>
	<p>"A story is a largely false account, of largely trivial events, fed to us by historians who are largely idiots"</p>
	<p>"My gleam penetrates the darkness, my brightness disperses the gloom."</p>
