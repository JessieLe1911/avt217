		<li>Draw two more squares (square2,3) underneath the rectangle, with w/h = 1/2 square1</li>
		<li>Put them under the lower corners of rec1</li>
		<li>Add some space among the elements, don't make them stick toghether.</li>

		<li>Underneath the eyes, draw square1's mouth, consists of 1 horizontal black rectangle (w = eyes'w; h = 1/2 eyes'h)</li>
