	<h1>1) The Last Wish (Book One in the Witcher Books Series)</h1>
	<p>Book Summary: Geralt is a Witcher, a man whose magic powers, enhanced by long training and a mysterious elixir, have made him a brilliant fighter and a merciless assassin. Yet he is no ordinary murderer: his targets are the multifarious monsters and vile fiends that ravage the land and attack the innocent.</p>
	<p>But not everything monstrous-looking is evil and not everything fair is goodâ€¦and in every fairy tale there is a grain of truth.</p>
